The doctor said I had a viral throat infection and gave me no medicines. but in two days it was so bad that I couldn't even talk. I did call for a follow up and they said I rather go to ER. instead, I went to another doctor and they said it was Strep throat. and immediately put me on antibiotics.   \n",

    "\n",
    "b) Misdiagnosed. The doctor said I had a viral throat infection and gave me no medicines. but in two days it was so bad that I couldn't even talk. I did call for a follow up and they said I rather go to ER. instead, I went to another doctor and they said it was Strep throat. and immediately put me on antibiotics."
